## AI-first & Illiterate-friendly UX Recommendations

- Goal: make the app usable by low-literacy users in Liberia and surface AI features to simplify tasks.
- UI principles
  - Minimal text, icon-first design, large touch targets (â‰¥44px), high contrast, simple language.
  - Use clear emojis/icons alongside short labels (e.g., ðŸ“± Electronics) and spoken labels.
  - Default to phone-first flows (phone required, email optional) and show example formats.
- Voice + Audio
  - Provide TTS prompts for forms and key actions (registration, add product, confirm).
  - Provide short audio confirmations for success/errors and audio-only navigation for onboarding.
- Visual affordances
  - Use large, consistent category chips with icons and optional color accents.
  - Use step-by-step wizards for multi-field flows (Add Product) with progress indicators.
- AI-assisted features
  - Smart form fill: suggest product title/category/tags from a short voice/text input using an AI helper.
  - Auto-generate friendly product descriptions from a few voice prompts (AI summarization).
  - Suggest price ranges based on category and local market data.
- Safety & trust
  - Prominent safety tips (meet in public, confirm contact) shown as audio + visual cue.
  - Seller verification badge workflow clearly explained in simple steps with audio.
- Performance & offline
  - Data-saving mode: low-bandwidth image thumbnails, defer full images until requested.
  - Save drafts locally and auto-sync when online.
- Localization
  - English + simple Liberian Pidgin English copy variants; all audio in the same languages.
- Measurement
  - Track success metrics for illiterate flows (voice interactions completed, drop-off points).
- Implementation note
  - Start with critical screens: Register, Login, Add Product, Product Detail, and Messages (future).
