Based on the Liberian context and current app state, here are my
  recommended next steps for better UX and user adoption:

  Priority 1: Localization & Cultural Adaptation üá±üá∑

  1. Location Dropdown with Liberian Cities

  Currently uses free text (AddProduct.tsx:325). Replace with:
  - Dropdown with major cities: Monrovia, Paynesville, Gbarnga,
  Buchanan, Kakata, Ganta, Zwedru, Voinjama, Harper, etc.
  - Organized by counties for better discovery
  - Optional text field for specific neighborhoods

  Todos
  ‚òê Create Liberian locations data file with counties and cities
  ‚òê Create phone validation utility for Liberian numbers
  ‚òê Update AddProduct form with location dropdown
  ‚òê Add payment method preferences field
  ‚òê Add price negotiable toggle
  ‚òê Update Register form with phone validation
  ‚òê Update Login form styling for consistency

  2. Phone Number Formatting

  - Add Liberian phone validation (+231 format)
  - Support local operators (Orange, Lonestar, Africell)
  - Clear placeholder: "+231-XX-XXX-XXXX"

  3. Mobile Money Integration

  Most critical for Liberia:
  - Add "Preferred Payment Method" field: Mobile Money (Orange Money,
  MTN, etc.), Cash on Delivery
  - Display payment icons buyers recognize
