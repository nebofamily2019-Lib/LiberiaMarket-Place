  The project appears to have core functionality implemented but needs initialization, testing, and deployment
  configuration

TODAY ACTION 10/06 2025

  The user wants to work on three things:
  1. Environment configuration files (.env)
  2. Deployed instances
  3. Tests not implemented

  This is a multi-step, complex task that will require tracking. I should use the TodoWrite tool to create a plan for
  these tasks.

  Let me break this down:
  1. Create environment configuration files for both frontend and backend
  2. Set up deployment configuration
  3. Implement tests for the backend and frontend

CRITICAL NEXT STEP"-:

  The user wants to create an API service layer and connect the
  frontend to the backend endpoints. This is a multi-step task
  that requires:

  1. Creating an API service/client layer
  2. Setting up axios for API calls
  3. Creating auth context/state management
  4. Integrating API calls into the pages (Login, Register,
  Products, etc.)
  5. Setting up protected routes
  6. Token storage and management

  This is a complex task that would benefit from a todo list to
  track progress. Let me create a plan and start implementing.

  First, I should:
  1. Check if axios is already installed
  2. Create API service layer structure
  3. Create auth context
  4. Update pages to use the API
  5. Add protected routes

  Let me start by creating a todo list and then begin
  implementation.

The user wants to create an API service layer and connect the
  frontend to the backend endpoints. This is a complex,
  multi-step task that would benefit from a todo list. Let me
  plan this out:

  1. Create API configuration/axios setup
  2. Create authentication service/API calls
  3. Create product service/API calls
  4. Create category service/API calls
  5. Create rating service/API calls
  6. Create auth context for state management
  7. Connect Login page to auth API
  8. Connect Register page to auth API
  9. Connect Products page to products API
  10. Connect ProductDetail page to products API
  11. Connect AddProduct page to products API
  12. Add protected routes
  13. Connect Profile page to user API

  This is definitely a complex multi-step task that requires the
  TodoWrite tool.

  Let me start by creating a comprehensive todo list and then
  begin implementing.

‚à¥ Thinking‚Ä¶

  Good, I've created the todo list. Now let me start
  implementing. I'll begin with the first task: creating the API
  configuration with axios setup.

  Let me check if axios is installed in the frontend first.
