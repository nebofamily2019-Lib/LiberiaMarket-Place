    - Already installed on most phones
  2. ‚úÖ Voice Search
    - Add microphone icon in search bar
    - Let users speak instead of type
    - Critical for illiterate users
  3. ‚úÖ Image-First Product Listing

  7. ‚úÖ Location with GPS

    - No typing addresses
  8. ‚úÖ Price Presets

    - Reduce typing

  MEDIUM PRIORITY:
