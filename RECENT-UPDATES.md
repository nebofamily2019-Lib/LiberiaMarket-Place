# Recent Updates - October 18, 2025

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Category Listing Fixed in Add New Product Screen

**Problem**: Categories were not showing up in the dropdown when sellers tried to list a new product.

**Root Cause**: The database had no categories populated.

**Solution**:
- Created `backend/seedCategories.js` script to populate default categories
- Successfully seeded 8 categories:
  - üì± Electronics
  - üëó Fashion
  - üè° Home & Garden
  - ‚öΩ Sports
  - üìö Books
  - üöó Vehicles
  - üîß Services
  - üì¶ Other

- Updated `frontend/src/pages/AddProduct.tsx` to:
  - Display category icons alongside names in dropdown
  - Show helpful error messages if categories fail to load
  - Better error handling with user feedback

**How to Use**:
- Categories are now automatically loaded from the database
- To re-seed categories: `cd backend && npm run seed:categories`
- Categories appear with their icons (e.g., "üì± Electronics")

### 2. Phone Number Requirement Removed for Product Listings

**Problem**: Sellers were required to enter a phone number when listing products, which was redundant since they already registered with a phone number.

**Solution**:
- Made phone number field **optional** in Add Product form
- Updated validation to only validate phone format if a phone number is provided
- If no phone number is entered, the system automatically uses the seller's registered phone number
- Added helpful text: "Leave blank to use your registered phone number (XXX)"

**Changes Made**:
- **File**: `frontend/src/pages/AddProduct.tsx`
  - Line 143-149: Changed phone validation to optional
  - Line 167-168: Auto-fill with user's registered phone if left blank
  - Line 392: Changed `required={true}` to `required={false}`
  - Line 395: Changed label to "Contact Phone Number (Optional)"
  - Line 397-399: Added helpful text showing user's registered number

**User Experience**:
- Sellers can now list products faster without re-entering their phone
- If they want to use a different contact number for a specific product, they can still enter it
- Invalid phone numbers are still validated if provided
