Codebase Review Complete

  I've reviewed the entire codebase and compared it against the LibeMarket business plan. Here's what I found:

  ✅ EXISTING FEATURES (Aligned with Plan)

  1. User Authentication - Complete JWT-based auth with email/phone verification
  2. Product Listings - Full CRUD with images, location, price, condition, negotiability
  3. Category Management - 8 default categories ready
  4. Rating System - 5-star user ratings implemented
  5. Location Support - Products and users have location fields
  6. Mobile-First Architecture - React SPA with TypeScript
  7. Security - Helmet, rate limiting, bcrypt password hashing
  8. Database Schema - Well-designed PostgreSQL with proper indexes

  ❌ MISSING FEATURES (Need Implementation)

  1. Messaging System - No buyer-seller chat (critical)
  2. Mobile Money Integration - Not implemented (critical for Liberia)
  3. Transaction Tracking - No transaction/order model
  4. Admin Dashboard - No admin UI
  5. Notifications - No notification system
  6. Face-to-face Exchange - Need explicit transaction type support

  ✨ GOOD NEWS

  No major code cleanup needed! The existing codebase is well-structured and aligns with the LibeMarket vision. The foundation is solid - we
   just need to add the missing features.

● Next Steps - What Would You Like To Work On?

  The codebase cleanup is complete! The existing code is solid and aligns well with the LibeMarket plan. Now we can focus on implementing
  the missing features:

  - Face-to-face transaction support

  Priority 3 (Polish & Deploy):
